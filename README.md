## Verbose Stylizer

This is a plugin for styling help in Obsidian. Currently it provides context menus with more metadata and attributes to be grabbed by custom CSS code.
One example is used in this plugin (see its styles.css if you're a fellow dev) but can be turned off. I plan on adding more if I get more ideas.

The example is called "Mindful Obsidian". It exists to highlight potentially dangerous actions such as file deletion in a warning color.
Currently it uses --text-error as a highlight color for those actions. Might change in the futureâ„¢.

## Install

Click on the releases tab (probably to the right of this explanation), download it, extract the files from the .zip and put the plugin folder into your vault into this folder:
/your_vault_name/.obsidian/plugins/

Then go to "Community Plugins" in Obsidian, click the reload button and enable this plugin.
